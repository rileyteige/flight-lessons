# Flight Simulators

**NOTE: This lesson plan is still an early rough-draft, and completely unusable.**

## Objective
To train the students in Flight Simulators, Flight Training Devices and Aviation Training Devices. The student will learn of their definitions and regulations, and how they can be used toward skill building and pilot certification experience requirements.

## Elements
- Definitions
- Benefits
- Regulations
- Application toward experience requirements

## Schedule
| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Ground Instruction | 0:30 |
| **Total** | **0:30** |

## Equipment
- FAR/AIM

## Instructor Actions

**Define Flight Simulator**

**Describe benefits of flight simulators** (Cost, training)

**Define Aviation Training Device**

Training device _other than Full-Flight Simulator or Flight Training Device_ that has been evaluated, qualified, and approved by the Administrator. (AC-61-136A, Appendix 1)

Generally includes replica of instruments, equipment, panels, and controls in open flight deck area or enclosed aircraft cockpit.

Includes hardware & software necessary to represent a category/class of aircraft (or set of aircraft) ops in ground and flight conditions.

|    |    |
| --- | --- |
| **Basic Aviation Training Device (BATD)** | Meets/exceeds training requirements in AC Appendix 2, BATD requirements. Provides adequate training platform for PPL and IR per 14 CFR §61 and §141. |
| **Advanced Aviation Training Device (AATD)** | Meets/exceeds BATD requirements and those in AC Appendix 3, AATD requirements. Provides adequate platform for PPL, IR, CPL, ATP, and CFI certificates per 14 CFR §61 and §141. Suitable for IPC. |

_NOTE: The minimum instrument and equipment requirements specified
under 14 CFR part 91, § 91.205 for day visual flights rules (VFR) and
instrument flight rules (IFR) must be functional during the training session._

**Define Flight Training Device**

Replica of aircraft instruments, equipment, panels, and controls in an open flight deck area or enclosed cockpit replica. Includes the equipment & computer programs necessary to represent aicraft (or set of aircraft) ops in ground & flight conditions having the full range of capabilities of the systems installed in the device as described in part 60, and the qualification performance standard (QPS) for a specific FTD training level.

**Remember:** If the simulator has a number, it doesn't move. If it has a letter, it moves and costs a lot of money.

**Remember:** The higher the number, or farther in the alphabet the letter, the more sophisticated the device. (i.e. Level D simulator outranks Level A)

**Describe simulator & training device regulations**

_FTD_
| Level | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
|   1   | Does not really exist, only old ones still in use. Old Level 1-3 FTDs grandfathered into this level (e.g. Ground Trainers). |
|   2   | No new Level 2's, used to be Personal Computer-based Aviation Training Devices (PCATDs). |
|   3   | No longer approved, now considered to be Advanced Aviation Training Devices (AATDs). See below. |
|   4   | Task Trainer, good for learning procedures. No control yoke. Expect to see touch screens that help to learn e.g. FMS procedures. |
|   5   | Represents a "class" of aircraft (single-engine, multiengine, etc) and also requires a Qualification & Approval Guide that contains FTD design criteria. Starts to look like the aircraft a student will fly. There is a yoke, for example. |
|   6   | Must be accurate for the aircraft to be flown, down to spatial relations and actual functions. Must also have a Qualification & Approval Guide, but makes use of more expensive aerodynamic data. Flies with more realism. |
|   7   | Reserved for helicopter simulators. |

_Authorized uses of a BATD_

- Completing an IPC with an instructor under FAR 61.57(c)(1), Circle-to-land NA.
- Up to 10 hours toward IR flight instruction time under §61.65(i) or Part 141 Appendix C.
- Meeting instrument recency of experience requirements of §61.57(c)(1)

_Authorized uses of an AATD_

- All BATD uses listed above.
- Completing an IR practical test in accordance with ACS, Circle-to-land NA.

**TODO:** Use towards flight reviews? Fit in FTD and FFS.

**Describe usage toward experience requirements**
