# Vmc Demonstration
_Commercial ACS: CA.X.B_

## Objective
To train the student in the identification of loss of directional control, coupled with skill training in the proper recovery procedures.

## Elements
- Factors affecting Vmc
- Vmc vs. Stall Speed
- Vmc vs. Red Line
- Cause of loss of directional control below Vmc
- Proper procedures for maneuver entry and safe recovery
- Risk management

## Schedule
| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight Instruction | 0:20 |
| Student Practice | 0:15 |
| Post-flight Instruction | 0:10 |
| **Total** | **0:45** |

## Equipment
- Multi-Engine Aircraft
- Multi-Engine Packet

## Instructor Actions
Reminder: _**Vmc**, minimum controllable airspeed, is the speed below which directional control cannot be maintained in a single-engine situation._

_"Red Line" is the **highest** Vmc attained by the manufacturer_

### How is Vmc affected?
**Rule of thumb:** In general, conditions that lower Vmc INCREASE control but DECREASE performance
- **CG Forward** (longer arm inc. rudder effectiveness)
- **Density Altitude** (high DA decreases asymmetric thrust potential - normally aspirated engines)
- **Power reduction on good engine** reduces asymmetric thrust
- **Feathering failed engine** reduces drag & yaw
- **Max T/O wt.** helps resist yaw (need more asymmetric thrust to overcome inc. momentum)
- **Increasing bank** can reduce Vmc by a 2-3 kts per degree of bank angle (but reduces vert. lift component)

### Vmc vs. Stall Speed
(see Multi-Engine Packet, pg. 9)

Stall speed is a characteristic of the airframe, constant with a given load factor / CG.

Vmc is a consequence of asymmetric thrust.

Therefore, if there is less asymmetric thrust available, less need rudder authority is needed; therefore Vmc won't occur until lower airspeeds.

Low Altitude: Vmc first

Crossing point: Caution for spin if stalled near this altitude

High Altitude: Stall first

### Vmc Entry and Recovery

1. Altitude – ABOVE 5,000’ AGL

...Configuration & clearing turns...

8. At Vyse (105 MPH):\
    a. LEFT ENGINE IDLE, COWL CLOSED\
    b. RIGHT ENGINE FULL POWER, COWL OPEN
9. Establish 5° Bank into the Good Engine
10. Climb at Vyse on Good Engine
11. Pitch up at 1 MPH per Second decrease in speed
12. At First Sign of: Heading Drift, Stall Buffet:\
    a. Lower Nose and Pitch for Vyse (105 MPH)\
    b. Reduce Power on Good Engine – AS REQUIRED
13. Recover within ±10° heading (ACS is ±20°)

...Clean up...

Note: We start above **5,000' AGL**..which do you think will happen first, stall or Vmc?

## Student Actions
- Perform a Vmc demonstration as outlined in the maneuver checklist
- Post-flight, demonstrate knowledge of Vmc and its relationships

## Keys to Success
- Pick good visual landmarks, a cloud in the distance if possible
    - As pitch is increased ground references become difficult to monitor
- Be vigilant for Vmc - as soon as heading drift occurs, recover swiftly
