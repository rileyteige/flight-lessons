### Explain Vacuum-Driven Gyroscopic Instruments

**Attitude Indicator**: Explain construction, behavior and indications

**Directional Gyro (Heading Indicator)**: Explain construction, behavior and indications, tick marks (45° tick marks), precession (check with magnetic compass every 15 minutes). Note: Heading indicator is always the primary instrument for bank.

### Explain Electric Gryoscopic Instruments

**Turn Coordinator (with Inclinometer)**: Explain needle and ball construction. Demonstrate and explain needle and ball behavior under all conditions. Discuss and explain needle and ball indications.

### Explain Pitot-Static System

**Airspeed Indicator**: Explain construction, demonstate and explain behavior, indications (V-speeds), types of airspeed, errors (pitot tube at high pitch attitude, slips). In straight-and-level flight the airspeed indicator is the primary power instrument. In constant-airspeed climbs and descents, the airspeed indicator is the primary pitch instrument.

**Altimeter**: Explain construction, behavior, types of altitudes, errors ("High to Low or Hot to Cold, Look Out Below!"). In straight-and-level flight the altimeter is the primary pitch instrument. Must indicate within 75' of runway elevation.

**Vertical Speed Indicator**: Explain construction, behavior, rate information (vertical speed) versus trend information (changes of vertical speed), 6-9 second lag. During constant-rate climbs and descents, the VSI is the primary pitch instrument.

### Explain Pitot-Static System Blockages

- Complete blockage (Pitot tube and drain, static ports): airspeed & altimeter constant, VSI indicates zero
- Pitot tube complete blockage (static port open): altimeter & VSI correct, airspeed reacts like altimeter
- Pitot tube blocked, drain clear (static port open): altimeter & VSI correct, airspeed decreases to zero
- Static port blocked (only): airspeed operates but will be erroneous
   - At higher altitude than when blockage occurred, airspeed shows slower than actual, and vice versa

### Explain Magnetic Compass

**Magnetic Compass**: Explain construction, demonstrate and explain behavior, variation (magnetic vs true north), deviation, magnetic dip errors (UNOS and ANDS).
- *Undershoot North, Overshoot South* (zero error on E/W heading)
- *Accelerate North, Decelerate South* (on E/W heading)

## Evaluation
Lesson is complete when student has a thorough knowledge of instrument construction, can correctly interpret all instrument indications, understands instrument errors, lags and blockages.
