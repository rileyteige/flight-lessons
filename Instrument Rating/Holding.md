# Holding

## Objective
To train the student in holding procedures.

## Elements
- Holding fix
- Holding radial or bearing
- Direction of turns
- Entry into a hold
- Timing of the in/outbound legs
- DME holds

## Schedule
| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight Instruction | 0:45 |
| Instructor Demo | 0:20 |
| Student Practice | 1:00 |
| Post-flight Instruction | 0:20 |
| **Total** | **2:25** |

## Equipment
- Aircraft equipped for IFR
- View-limiting device
- Terminal Approach Procedures
- IFR Low En-Route Charts

## Instructor Actions
Discuss the purpose of a hold and how to find published holds. Discuss the holding fix and the radial or bearing it is situated on.

Discuss direction of turns and other elements of hold:
- Standard Holding Pattern (right-hand turns) or non-standard (left-hand turns)
- 1-minute inbound leg
- Standard-rate turns
- Wind correction: compensate when turning, adjust outbound timing to achieve a 1-minute inbound leg (1-1/2 minute above 14,000 feet)
    - For the outbound leg, triple the wind corrections use on the inbound leg

Discuss expect-further clearance (EFC) time.

Discuss holding side versus unprotected non-holding side.

Discuss non-published holding patterns (holding fix; direction of hold; radial, course, bearing, waypoint; leg length, direction of turns; EFC). _Example: "Cessna 12345, hold west on the 270° radial of the Topeka VOR, time now 1855Z, EFC 1930Z."_ Tip: the direction given in the clearance represents the direction of the **outbound** leg. Just flip for the inbound!

Discuss DME holding: Same entry and holding procedure, however time value of the legs is replaced with a distance in NM and is used outbound instead of inbound. **Outbound leg is used for DME distance, inbound leg is used for timing in traditional holds.** (**TODO: Source?**)

How to draw a hold: 1) Draw specified holding course; 2) start at the fix; 3) show direction of turn at the fix; 4) note other details (EFC, DME, distance, time, etc). _Example: "Cessna 12345, hold east of the 20 DME fix on the 270° radial of the Santa Monica VOR, 5 mile legs, time 1435Z, EFC 1510Z."_ Recall: direction given in the clearance ("east") represents direction of the **outbound** leg.

Discuss entries into a hold: Parallel, Teardrop, Direct. How to draw: 1) Draw the holding pattern; 2) draw a line perpendicular to the course through the fix; 3) Draw a line 70° up from the course through the fix, on the opposite side of the holding "race track". This 70° swath or "pie" is the teardrop entry direction; the entire 180° section opposite is the direct entry direction. The remaining 110° swath is the parallel entry direction.

Discuss maximum holding speeds: Up to 6,000' MSL, 200 KIAS; 6,001-14,000' MSL, 230 KIAS; 14,001' MSL and above, 265 KIAS.

"Chair-fly" a couple holds on the ground, including slowing to an efficient hold speed within 3 minutes of holding fix, "setting" nav frequencies and OBS, expected indications for course tracking and when outbound leg timing starts.

Demonstrate holding entry, holding procedures, communications and exit.

## Student Actions
Perform entries into holds from a variety of angles and navigation methods, maintaining holding pattern as directed.

## Evaluation
- Exhibits adequate knowledge of the elements related to holding procedures.
- Changes to the holding airspeed appropriate for the altitude or aircraft when 3 minutes or less from, but prior to arriving at, the holding fix.
- Explains and uses an entry procedure that ensures the aircraft remains within the holding pattern airspace for a standard, nonstandard, published, or non-published holding pattern.
- Recognizes arrival at the holding fix and initiates a prompt entry into the holding pattern.
- Complies with ATC reporting requirements.
- Uses the proper timing criteria, where applicable, as required by altitude or ATC instructions.
- Complies with pattern leg lengths when a DME distance is specified.
- Uses proper wind correction procedures to maintain the desired pattern and arrive over the fix as close as possible to a specified time.
- Maintains airspeed ±10kts, altitude ±100', headings ±10°, and tracks a selected course, radial or bearing within 3/4 scale deflection of the CDI.

## Common Errors
- Incorrect setting of aircraft navigation equipment.
- Incorrect visualization of hold.
- Non-standard rate turns.
- Improper timing.
- Improper wind drift correction.
- Failure to recognize holding fix passage.
- Failure to include navigation instruments in scan.
- Failure to comply with ATC instructions.
