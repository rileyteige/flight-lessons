# VOR Navigation

## Objective
To train the student in VOR navigation and intercepting VOR courses.

## Elements
- VOR background
- Tuning and identifying
- Selecting a radial
- Turning to a VOR
- Station passage
- Reverse sensing
- Intercepting radials
- VOR intersections
- VOR failure and equipment currency

## Schedule
| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight Instruction | 1:00 |
| Instructor Demo | 0:30 |
| Student Practice | 1:00 |
| Post-flight Instruction | 0:30 |
| **Total** | **3:00** |

## Equipment
- Aircraft equipped for IFR
- View-limiting device
- IFR En-Route Low Altitude Charts
- Chart Supplement
- CDI examples for teaching position
- RMI examples

## Instructor Actions
Explain what a VOR is (VHF Omnidirectional Range), what it provides ("highways in the sky"). Explain VOR, VOR/DME, TACAN, VORTAC.

Explain and demo how to find VOR information, tune it and identify it.

Explain what a radial (FROM) is and how to fly to a station (simple case: 360°).

Explain and demo interpretation of a CDI (Course Deviation Indicator; 10° full deflection, each dot 2°).

Explain and demo interpretation of an RMI (Radio Magnetic Indicator).

Explain effect of heading on VOR usage. **TODO: elaborate in lesson plan more on this**

Explain and demo intercepting and tracking of a pre-determined course.

Explain and demo wind correction.

Explain and demo reverse sensing.

Explain and demo identification of VOR intersections.

Explain how to identify VOR failures.

Explain and demo one method of required 30-day VOR accuracy check requirement ([14 CFR §91.171](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=14:2.0.1.3.10#se14.2.91_1171)):

_Note: CS refers to the FAA's published Chart Supplement_

| Method | Description | Error Limits |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ |
| VOT | Check via single VOT station (published in CS). Repair stations can use test transmitters as well. | ±4°, (182: 180 TO) |
| Ground Checkpoint | Check via published (CS) point-on-surface checkpoint. | ±4° |
| Airborne Checkpoint | Check via published (CS) airborne checkpoint. | ±6° |
| Over Known Position | Check over prominent landmark (> 20nm away preferred), note bearing | ±6° |
| Dual VOR | Check two independent VORs by setting to same station, noting both bearings | Variation  ±4° |

Explain required info for logging a VOR check (Date, VOR, Bearing Error, Pilot Signature).
If repair station's test transmitter is used to verify, repair station representative must make airplane logbook entry with date.

## Student Actions
| | Action |
|-| ------ |
| | Tune and ID a VOR. |
| | Identify position of aircraft relative to a VOR. |
| | Fly a course direct to a VOR and identify station passage. |
| | Identify reverse sensing and how to correct for it. |
| | Intercept and track a VOR course as directed. |
| | Identify a VOR intersection. |
| | Explain and perform a VOR accuracy check. |

## Evaluation
- Exhibits adequate knowledge of the elements related to VOR information, usage and navigation via CDI and RMI.
- Tunes and correctly identifies the navigation facility.
- Sets and correctly orients the course to be intercepted into the CDI.
- Intercepts the specified course at a predetermined angle, inbound or outbound from a VOR facility.
- Maintains airspeed ±10kts, altitude ±100', selected headings ±5°.
- Applies proper correction to maintain a course, remaining within 3/4-scale deflection of CDI or within ±10° in case of an RMI.
- Determines aircraft position relative to the VOR facility.
- Recognizes VOR receiver or facility failure, if applicable.

## Common Errors
- Careless tuning and identification of station.
- Failure to interpret receiver accuracy/sensitivity.
- Turning in wrong direction during orientation (common when visualizing position rather than heading).
- Failure to check ambiguity (TO/FROM) indicator (reverse sensing).
- Overshooting or undershooting radials on interception.
- Overcontrolling corrections when tracking, especially close to the station.
- Misinterpretation of station passage.
- Chasing the CDI: homing, rather than tracking.
