# ILS and LOC Approaches

## Objective
To train the student in techniques required to safely fly an ILS approach, Localizer approach and Localizer Backcourse approach.

## Elements
- Selecting the IAP chart
- Interpreting and briefing the approach
- The 5 A's
- How to fly the approach

## Schedule
| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight Instruction | 0:30 |
| Instructor Demo | 0:20 |
| Student Practice | 1:00 |
| Post-flight Instruction | 0:20 |
| **Total** | **2:10** |

## Equipment
- Aircraft equipped for IFR
- View-limiting device
- Terminal Approach Procedures

## Instructor Actions
Discuss Terminal Approach Procedures format and interpretation
    - Plan & Profile view
    - Minimums & Categories, Timing chart

Explain a precision approach versus a non-precision approach.

Discuss hardware on the ground (LOC typically 1000' departure end of runway, 3-6° of course width tailored to provide 700' at threshold; GS on the left side of the approach end of the runway with approx. 1.4° width).

Explain DH (typically 200' AGL) versus MDA and runway environment (14 CFR 19.175).

Discuss considerations of ILS, backing up with timing for a LOC approach and marker beacons.

Discuss the ground-based hardware of ILS. Discuss usage of the GS indicator.

Discuss sensitivity of the ILS (ILS = 2.5° deflection either side, GS = 1.4° deflection either side).

Demo briefing an approach.

Discuss the 5 A's:
    - ATIS
    - Altimeter
    - Approach (Which way? How far down? How long to MAP?)
    - Avionics setup
    - Airspeed stable

Demo ATC instructions and correct radio procedures.

Demo and explain a full ILS, LOC and BC approach.

## Student Actions
Brief an ILS, LOC or BC approach.

Perform the 5 A's.

Perform an ILS, LOC or BC approach as directed.

## Evaluation
- Exhibits adequate knowledge of the precision instrument approach procedures.
- Accomplishes the appropriate precision instrument approaches as selected by the instructor/examiner.
- Establishes two-way communications with ATC using the proper communications phraseology and techniques, as required for the phase of flight or approach segment.
- Complies, in a timely manner, with all clearances, instructions, and procedures.
- Advises ATC any time that the applicant is unable to comply with a clearance.
- Establishes the appropriate airplane configuration and airspeed/V-speed considering turbulence, wind shear, or other meteorological and operating conditions.
- Completes the aircraft checklist items appropriate to the phase of flight or approach segment, including engine out approach and landing checklists, if appropriate.
- Prior to beginning the final approach segment, maintains the desired altitude ±100', airspeed ±10kts, heading ±10°, and accurately tracks radials, courses and bearings.
- Selects, tunes, identifies, and monitors the operational status of ground and airplane navigation equipment used for the approach.
- Applies the necessary adjustments to the published DA/DH and visibility criteria for the airplane approach category as required, such as--
    - NOTAMs
    - INOP airplane and ground navigation equipment
    - INOP visual aids associated with the landing environment
    - NWS reporting factors and criteria
- Establishes a predetermined rate of descent at the point where the electronic glide slope begins, which approximates that required for the aircraft to follow the glide slope.
- Maintains a stabilized final approach, from the FAF to DA/DH allowing no more than 3/4-scale deflection of either the glide slope or localizer indications and maintains desired airspeed ±10kts.
- A missed approach or transition to landing shall be initiated at Decision Height.
- Immediately initiates the missed approach when at the DA/DH, and the required visual references for the runway are not unmistakably visible and identifiable.
- Transitions to a normal landing approach only when the aircraft is in a position from which a descent to a landing on the runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvering.
- Maintains localizer and glide slope within 3/4-scale deflection of the indicators during the visual descent from DA/DH to a point over the runway where glide slope must be abandoned to accomplish a normal landing.

## Common Errors
- Failure to have essential knowledge of the information on the instrument approach chart.
- Incorrect communications procedures or noncompliance with ATC clearances.
- Faulty basic instrument flying technique.
- Inappropriate descent below the MDA or DH.
