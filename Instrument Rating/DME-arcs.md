# DME Arcs

## Objective
To train the student in DME arc navigation.

## Elements
- DME background
- Tuning and identifying
- Entering arc
- Tracking arc
- Departing arc

## Schedule
| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight Instruction | 0:30 |
| Instructor Demo | 0:20 |
| Student Practice | 0:45 |
| Post-flight Instruction | 0:20 |
| **Total** | **1:55** |

## Equipment
- Aircraft equipped for IFR with DME capabilities
- View-limiting device
- Terminal Approach Procedures

## Instructor Actions
Explain DME (slant range), DME sources (VORTAC, VOR/DME, DME), DME arc and why it is used for IAP's.

Explain arc is actually a series of short, straight legs.

Explain and demo how to tune and identify DME station.

Demo tracking a designated radial and entry into the arc (lead the turn by 0.5 NM if GS < 150kts).

Explain overshoot, undershooting and ±1 NM tolerance.

Explain and demo wind correction (correct 10-20° extra for each 0.5nm deviation).

Explain and demo re-centering CDI and note new primary heading indicated whenever the CDI has moved 2-4°, or the "turn 10° twist 10°" method as an alternate.

Identify lead radials (typically 5°, or for a LOC, 7°), use half-standard-rate turns to enter, and demo exit procedure.

## Student Actions
Tune and ID a DME.

Identify position of aircraft relative to a VOR.

Intercept and track a DME arc as directed.

Depart a DME arc as directed.

## Evaluation
- Exhibits adequate knowledge of the elements related to intercepting and tracking navigational systems and DME arcs.
- Tunes and correctly identifies the navigation facility.
- Sets and correctly orients the course to be intercepted into the course selector or correctly identifies the course on the RMI, if installed.
- Intercepts the specified course at a predetermined angle, inbound or outbound from a navigational facility.
- Maintains the airspeed within ±10kts, altitude ±100', selected headings ±5°.
- Applies the proper correction to maintain a course, allowing no more than 3/4-scale deflection of the CDI or within ±10° in the case of an RMI.
- Determines the aircraft position relative to the navigational facility or from a waypoint in the case of GPS.
- Intercepts a DME arc and maintains that arc within ±1 NM.
- Recognizes navigational receiver or facility failure, and when required, reports the failure to ATC.

## Common Errors
- Improper identification of DME station.
- Improper interception of DME arc (lead turn).
- Poor tracking of DME arc.
- Improper departure from DME arc.
