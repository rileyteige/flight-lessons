# How to Fly an ILS

## Objective
To teach the student the principles of flying an ILS, namely the skills involved, execution and considerations.

## Elements
- Preparing for the approach
- Establishing the localizer
- Intercepting glideslope
- Keeping the needles centered

## Schedule

| Task | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight Instruction | 0:20 |
| Instructor Demo | 0:15 |
| Student Practice | 1:00 |
| Post-flight Discussion | 0:10 |
| **Total** | **1:45** |

## Equipment
- Aircraft equipped for IFR
- View-limiting Device
- Current TERPS chart to be used for flight
    - Instructor Note: for first ILS flight, recommend avoiding tracking outbound/procedure turns
- Whiteboard & Markers

## Instructor Actions
Discuss flying own-nav (feeder routes) vs radar vectors to establish ILS localizer

**If ILS to be used includes procedure turn:** Discuss tracking outbound / flying a procedure turn to reverse course
- Reverse sensing outbound
- _After reaching PT fix, turn 45° in direction of barb, time 1 minute_
- _At 1 minute, make 180° (1 minute) turn away from airport (makes establishing LOC easier)_
- _Will be on 45° intercept to LOC w/ normal sensing_
- Discuss PT & IAP profile view altitudes, distance limitations

Discuss preparation:
- Perform the 5 A's (ATIS, Altimeter, Approach (below), Avionics, Airspeed)
- During approach briefing, include: tune/identify LOC & any secondary VORs to be used
- When cleared for approach:
    - Unless instructed (and accepted) to fly higher speed, establish approach speed. (90 kts recommended in 172)
    - Set ATIS altimeter setting

Discuss localizer needle movement during establish maneuver

Discuss establishing approach altitude after establishing LOC
- Fly into GS from underneath, not from above

Discuss glideslope intercept: preparation, indications and actions to be taken
- "Glideslope Alive": Gear down, approach flaps, Before Landing checklist complete
- Outer marker, when included, will be placed here
- Start timer
- Ensure tracking VLOC if GPS equipped

Discuss maintaining localizer and glideslope, increasing sensitivity
- Constant power settings, observe needle movements
- Power for glideslope (most of the time)
- Hold headings, observe needle movements
- Standard-rate turns outside FAF, half-standard inside FAF
- Avoid "chasing the needles"

Discuss monitoring/calling altitude relative to Decision Altitude (e.g. "400 to minimums...300 to mins")

Discuss DA "continue" vs "going missed"
- What must be true to continue below DA? DA-100?

Discuss typical Missed Approach procedure
- Establish initial climb, positive rate gear-up, flaps up w/ Vy, continue to track _extremely sensitive_ LOC.
- When LOC fluctuates signalling passing overhead, focus on maintaining heading until it returns
- Execute remaining missed approach instructions

Mention glideslope failure & reverting to LOC approach

## Student Actions

Brief an ILS approach.

Perform the 5 A's.

Perform an ILS approach as directed.

## Evaluation

- Exhibits adequate knowledge of ILS approach procedures.
- Accomplishes the appropriate ILS approaches as selected by the instructor.
- Complies, in a timely manner, with all clearances, instructions, and procedures.
- Advises ATC/instructor any time that the applicant is unable to comply with a clearance.
- Establishes the appropriate airplane configuration and airspeed/V-speed considering turbulence, wind shear, or other meteorological and operating conditions.
- Completes the aircraft checklist items appropriate to the phase of flight or approach segment.
- Prior to beginning the final approach segment, maintains the desired altitude ±100', airspeed ±10kts, heading ±10°, and accurately tracks radials, courses and bearings.
- Selects, tunes, identifies, and monitors the operational status of ground and airplane navigation equipment used for the approach.
- Applies the necessary adjustments to the published DA/DH and visibility criteria for the airplane approach category as required, such as--
    - NOTAMs
    - INOP airplane and ground navigation equipment
    - INOP visual aids associated with the landing environment
    - NWS reporting factors and criteria
- Establishes a predetermined rate of descent at the point where the electronic glide slope begins, which approximates that required for the aircraft to follow the glide slope.
- Maintains a stabilized final approach, from the FAF to DA/DH allowing no more than 3/4-scale deflection of either the glide slope or localizer indications and maintains desired airspeed ±10kts.
- A missed approach or transition to landing shall be initiated at Decision Altitude.
- Immediately initiates the missed approach when at the DA/DH, and the required visual references for the runway are not unmistakably visible and identifiable.
- Transitions to a normal landing approach only when the aircraft is in a position from which a descent to a landing on the runway can be made at a normal rate of descent using normal maneuvering.
- Maintains localizer and glide slope within 3/4-scale deflection of the indicators during the visual descent from DA/DH to a point over the runway where glide slope must be abandoned to accomplish a normal landing.

## Keys to Success
- Identify LOC & any supplemental VORs.
- Ensure VLOC navigation mode when equipped with an IFR-capable GPS.
- Complete checklists prior to FAF so all you have to do is fly the airplane.
- Comply with all clearances, call "unable" when appropriate.
- Remember attitude instrument flying fundamentals! (keep that scan going)
- Turn immediately to intercept LOC to prevent flying beyond LOC course. Delay only if sensitivity obviously low.
- Make very small adjustments (2° heading change, 50 RPM/half-inch MP).
- Maintain constant attitudes/power settings. Don't "chase the needles".
- Descend below DA only when appropriate.
- If flying the missed approach, continue tracking LOC after initiating the procedure.
