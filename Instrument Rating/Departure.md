# Departure

## Departure Charts
Departure Procedures (DP) simplify complex procedures, reduce frequency congestion, ensure obstacle clearance, control traffic flow around airports, and might incorporate noise abatement. 

Can be found in TERPs publications.

## Departure Standards
DPs are designed according to the _U.S. Standard for Terminal Instrument Procedures (TERPs)_.

They assume at least the following takeoff & climb performance:

- Cross end of runway @ 35' AGL
- **Climb gradient** of 200 ft/nm
- Climb to 400' AGL within 2nm before reaching a point where a turn is required.

FAA ensures no obstructions penetrate the _shallower_ gradient of 152 ft/nm. If obstructions penetrate this climb gradient, then the departure may be altered by:

- Requiring a steeper climb gradient for departing traffic
- Establishing a minimum ceiling to allow visual obstruction clearance

Routing is based on departing aircraft receiving positive course guidance within

- 10nm on straight-out departures, or
- 5nm after completion of turns for departures requiring an turning maneuvers.

ATC radar services can be used for establishing positive course guidance.
