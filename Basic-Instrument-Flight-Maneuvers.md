# Basic Instrument Flight Maneuvers

## Objective
To train the student in basic flight maneuvers solely by reference to instruments.

## Elements
- Instrument scanning
- Instrument interpretation
- Aircraft attitude control
- Straight-and-Level flight
- Climbs and descents
- Standard-rate turns
- Climbing and descending turns
- Airspeed changes
- Steep turns
- Slow flight

## Schedule
| Item | ETE |
| ---- | --- |
| Pre-flight instruction | 0:30 |
| Instructor demonstrate | 0:30 |
| Student practice | 1:20 |
| **Total** | **2:20** |

## Equipment
- Aircraft equipped for IFR
- View-limiting device
- Whiteboard/Marker or Pen/Paper

## Instructor Actions
Demonstrate an effective and thorough instrument scan. Demonstrate correct instrument cross-reference, interpretation and aircraft control. Demonstrate use of trim.

**Straight-and-Level Flight**: Demonstrate maintaining heading and altitude. Demonstrate how to cross-reference other instruments to verify straight-and-level. (4 bank instruments, 4 pitch instruments.) Pitch only one-half bar width on the attitude indicator for less than 100' altitude change.

**Climbs and Descents**: Demonstrate climbs and descents using airspeed only. Demonstrate climbs and descents using vertical speed only. Demonstrate climbs and descents using both airspeed and vertical speed. Demonstrate proper power management in climbs and descents. Pitch, Power, and Trim (in that order) for climbs; Power, Pitch, and Trim for descents. Explain leveling out: for climbs, 10% of climb rate prior to altitude; for descents: 100-150' prior to altitude.

**Standard-Rate Turns**: Demonstrate proper instrument interpretation. Demonstrate good airspeed control. Explain rolling out: 50% of bank angle prior to heading.

**Climbing and Descending Turns**: Demonstrate climbs and descents using both airspeed and constant vertical speed while maintaining a standard rate turn.

**Airspeed Changes**: Demonstrate good power control during acceleration and deceleration during straight-and-level flight. Demonstrate standard-rate turns with airspeed changes. Demonstrate climbs and descents with leveling off at higher or lower speeds (25% of fpm).

**Steep Turns**: Demonstrate turns at 45° of bank.

**Slow Flight**: Demonstrate maneuvering at 1.3 V<sub>SO</sub>

## Student Actions
Perform all full-panel exercises as directed. Demonstate proper instrument interpretation. Demonstrate good coordination on all flight controls. Demonstrate proper use of power and trim.

Demonstrate straight-and-level flight.

Demonstrate constant-rate climbs and descents. Demonstrate constant-airspeed climbs and descents.

Demonstrate standard-rate turns to various headings.

Demonstrate climbing and descending standard-rate turns. Perform a 360° standard rate turn while maintaining a constant 500fpm climb. At the completion, should be on original heading but 1000' higher. Perform a 360° standard-rate turn in the opposite direction while maintaining a constant 500fpm descent. At the completion, should be on original heading and original altitude.

Demonstrate maneuvering with airspeed changes.

Demonstrate steep turns.

Demonstrate slow flight with half-standard-rate turns.

## Evaluation
- Exhibits adequate knowledge of the elements related to attitude instrument flying during straight-and-level, climbs, turns, and descents while conducting various instrument flight procedures.
- Maintains altitude ±100' during level flight, headings ±10°, airspeed ±10kts, and bank angles ±5° during turns.
- Uses proper instrument cross-check and interpretation, and applies the appropriate pitch, bank, power, and trim corrections when applicable.
